            I want to dedicate the memory of my cat Fatty Mc Fat Fat. However, this site will be for other
            folks who had similar big fat orange cats and want to share their stories of their cats with other people. I
            want this site to be comforting and peaceful. An enjoyable experience for those folks who are
            heartbroken about losing their fat orange cats to old age

               She may not be an orange fat cat but Jezebel did have some orange, so that counts right?
               She was my best friend in Germany where she was born and adopted. Her meows had a German accent and she
               was great at bread loafing.
               Here she is with her knitted kitty kitty shark hat that she loved...as you can tell.
